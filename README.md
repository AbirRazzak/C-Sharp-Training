# C-Sharp-Training
A collection of individual projects utilizing C# in an attempt to learn the language through experiential learning.

**_Project 1:_** Anagrams - Simple anagram console program that takes 2 strings and tells the user if they are anagrams of each other.

~~**_Project 2:_** Gigabyte Converter - A Windows Form Application that was supposed to convert units of memory to each other.~~ Got bored of it pretty quick and dropped this project.

**_Project 3:_** Discord Bot - .NET Discord Bot that runs off of the console. Has neat features like creating twitter links and creating dialogue.
